pokepicker
==========

This is a random-pokémon-generator which spits out the names in German, 
English and Japanese (romaji) as well as a link to a corresponding sprite 
image for one Pokémon at a time. The script uses urllib to fetch data from 
the German site pokewiki.de . Clean information is stored in a CSV file so 
the script can also be used offline.
